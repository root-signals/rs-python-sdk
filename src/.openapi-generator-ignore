# OpenAPI Generator Ignore
# Generated by openapi-generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator

# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

# As an example, the C# client generator defines ApiClient.cs.
# You can make changes and tell OpenAPI Generator to ignore just this file by uncommenting the following line:
#ApiClient.cs

# You can match any string of characters against a directory, file or extension with a single asterisk (*):
#foo/*/qux
# The above matches foo/bar/qux and foo/baz/qux, but not foo/bar/baz/qux

# You can recursively match patterns against a directory, file or extension with a double asterisk (**):
#foo/**/qux
# This matches foo/bar/qux, foo/baz/qux, and foo/bar/baz/qux

# You can also negate patterns with an exclamation (!).
# For example, you can ignore all files in a docs folder with the file extension .md:
root/generated/openapi_client/docs/*.md
root/generated/openapi_client/test/*
# root/generated/openapi_client/api/auth*
# root/generated/openapi_client/api/health*
# root/generated/openapi_client/api/apikeys*
# root/generated/openapi_client/api/chatbot*
# root/generated/openapi_client/api/dataset_drafts*
# root/generated/openapi_client/api/organizations*
# root/generated/openapi_client/models/api_key*
# root/generated/openapi_client/models/password*
# root/generated/openapi_client/models/social*
# root/generated/openapi_client/models/verify_email*
root/__init__.py


# Then explicitly reverse the ignore rule for a single file:
#!docs/README.md
